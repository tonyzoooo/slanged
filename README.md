## Contents

There are three different games in this project

- Hangman
- Guess the word
- Match the word

A fourth game (crossword) was planned but due to the lack of time, it has not been implemented.

## Learning words
While playing the games, the program keeps track of the encountered words along with their definitions in a file created at the root of the repository (vocabulary.txt).

It allows the user to go back and check if they know the word.
